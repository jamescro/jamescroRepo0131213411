# Major services and features in Microsoft Graph

<!-- That link to the MS API guidelines - should that point to the vnext branch, or 
master branch? My search result is the former.
-->
The vast resources in Microcosft Graph are backed by robust services. Some of these services 
make their debut in Microsoft Graph, others were available as standalone services at an earlier 
point and are converging in Microsoft Graph. Their API sets are streamlined in design and follow 
the [Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines), accessible by the single Microsoft Graph REST endpoint `https://graph.microsoft.com`. The major services and features are listed below by category.
